# BE Project briefing

## Project Overview:

The aim of this project is to develop a full-stack web application for a tour company. The application will include both frontend and backend components, with a particular focus on the backend development.
The web store will allow users to browse tours, add them to their favourites tours, and make the booking using the favourite tours or in their tour detail list. The client will also capable of making his registration and edit his profile.

### Tours Catalog:

Develop a product catalog where users can view the details of the tour such as name, description, price, location, duration, price per person and images.

### Favourite Tours:

Implement a favourit tours page allows users to add tours that they enjoy, and later choose the amount of people that will participate in the activitie, date for the booking and they can choose their guide. From here they can make the booking.

### Checkout Process:

No payment is required. The payment will be made with the guide in the day of activitie.

### User Authentication:

Implement user authentication functionality to allow users to create accounts, login, and logout.

### Admin Panel:

Implement an admin panel where authorised users can manage the client list, tours list, bookings list, guides list and other manageres account. Admins will be able to add, edit, and delete all the information but manager_id=1 will be the only one that can not be deleted, and only this manager can delete, add or edit other managers.
